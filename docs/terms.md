# Terms

Last updated Sep 23rd, 2023.

We are Lamin Labs GmbH (registered with number HRB 279584) trading as Lamin.

Our registered address is:
Ruth Drexel Str. 122,
81927 Munich,
Germany.

If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at `imprint@lamin.ai`.

Lamin operates the lamin.ai website, which provides

1. documentation for an open-source software package called LaminDB
2. a web service called LaminHub to connect & explore so-called "LaminDB instances"

By using our service (LaminHub) you accept these Terms. If you disagree with these Terms, you must not use our Service.

In using our service, we may process your personal data; more information about this can be found in the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy).

## Subscriptions

### Free plan

On a free plan, the Service will be provided to you as is based on the Terms described on this page.

### Enterprise plan

On an enterprise plan, you engage us in a dedicated agreement that may amend the Terms described on this page. Most importantly, the Enterprise Plan enables usage of LaminHub for private data & support. For details, see [pricing](https://lamin.ai/pricing).

## Performance of the Service

During your use of the Service, we will take steps to ensure that the Service functions as described.

What happens when the Service stops working as described? If you report to us a substantial error with the Service, we will seek to correct this within a reasonable amount of time – where legally permitted, this will be your sole remedy.

You must maintain a secure internet connection. Where you lose access to the Service and any User Content due to a disruption in your telecommunications or internet services, we will in no way be liable for any losses suffered.

Where our Service contains links to other sites, User Content, and resources provided by third parties, these are provided for your information only. They should not be interpreted as our approval of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them.

## Stored data

For privacy-related data, see the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy).

If you create a "LaminDB instance" and decide to "register it on lamin.ai", we store:

- a string reference to a default storage location, like `"s3://my-bucket"`
- the database connection string that you provide
- the schema module identifiers that you provide

These data are sufficient for you to load instances from any computer through LaminHub, assuming you manage secrets and VPCs client side.

We do _not_ store any of your R&D data.

If you do not explicitly grant us access through secrets to storage or database within an Enterprise Plan engagement, Lamin will not be able to access your data.

In case you provide us with secrets, we will store them in a secure way (Secret store, Vault). They are decoupled from all our infrastructure and solely used so that you can explore your LaminDB instances through LaminHub. At any time, you will be able to revoke Lamin's access by invalidating secrets.

## Intellectual property

We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in the Service, including any modifications and improvements made by us or suggested by you. Copyright laws and treaties around the world protect those works. All such rights are reserved. We provide you with a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable limited term licence for internal use only to use the Service in accordance with these Terms. Such a right to use the Service and any User Content on the Service will expire at the point your subscription ends or when we terminate the Agreement, whichever is sooner.

Data you transmit through the Service. All documents, messages, logos, images, files, and other information you transmit through our Service, will remain yours and you shall retain all rights, titles and interest in those.

## Cancellation

Your free plan will start when you sign up as a service user and agree to these Terms. Your access to the service will continue until the earlier of you canceling your subscription, we terminate your right to access the service, or you commit a material breach of these Terms.

If you wish to cancel the free plan, you can do this via email to: `support@lamin.ai`.

Deletion of data. We will only retain your data for as long as we need it. Your data is usually deleted 6 months after the deactivation of your account with us, unless we are required to keep it for longer to comply with our legal, accounting, or regulatory requirements.

Survival of important terms. Please note that all rights under this Agreement, which by nature should survive termination, will, including Indemnity, Liability, Governing Law, Notices and Intellectual Property.

## Indemnity

Your indemnity to us. You agree to indemnify us, our affiliates, directors, officers, and employees against all loss, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses that arise out of your breach of these Terms and/ or use of the Service.

## Liability

We do not limit any losses that we are not allowed to limit: We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so including death or personal injury caused by our negligence.

What we do limit: We exclude all implied conditions, warranties, representations or other terms that may apply to our Service or any Services on it. We will not be liable to you for any loss or damage, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, even if foreseeable, arising under or in connection with the use of, or inability to use, our Service; or use of or reliance on any Services displayed on our Service.

In particular, we will not be liable for loss of profits, sales, business, or revenue; business interruption; loss of anticipated savings; loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; or any indirect or consequential loss or damage.

No services guarantees. The Service is provided “as is”. We make no guarantee as to the quality of the Service and its suitability for your individual purposes, and will not be liable in the event you do not undertake your own prior due diligence.

Severability. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

## Governing law

What laws apply to these Terms? These terms are governed by English law, and you can bring legal proceedings in the English courts.
However, if you are a consumer, you may also benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in these Terms affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.

Changes to these Terms. As our service grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms. We will do this by uploading the latest version with a date confirming when they went live.
